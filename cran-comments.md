## Resubmission

* The flagship function now outputs more measures.

* We removed a default from one of the main arguments (`year`).

* We changed some of the package versions in the Imports and Suggests.

* We added a lot of comments and updated the documentation and README.


## Test environments:

* CentOS Linux 8, R 4.0.3
* Ubuntu Linux 20.04.1 LTS, R-release 4.0.4
* win-builder devel


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There continues to be a persistent NOTE on some platforms that the URL https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html in get_adi.Rd may be invalid, but it is not.
